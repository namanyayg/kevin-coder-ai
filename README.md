## Motivations

Since I started freelancing around ~10 years ago, it has been a dream of mine to create a bot that could write code for me (so I could delegate the boilerplate and focus on the creative parts of programming).

Seeing Devin made me realize that my teenage dream is close to becoming reality. For personal satisfaction, I’ve embarked on making my own open-source interface.

The name comes from the legendary phreaker and my childhood hero Kevin Mitnick and is a play on Cognition Labs’ product name.

Kevin is a hobby project, I am usually actively working on <a href="https://nmn.gl/">something else</a>.
